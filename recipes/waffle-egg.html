<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Classic egg in a hole is made inside a waffle for a sweet, buttery flavor and added crunch.</p>
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li>1 frozen waffle</li>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons shredded cheese</li>
    <li>maple syrup to taste</li>
</ul>
<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Cut a hole in the center of the frozen waffle using the rim of a cup of glass. Move waffle to a square of parchment paper, then carefully place the parchment paper into the preheated air fryer, along with the small center waffle.</li>
    <li>Crack egg directly into the center of the waffle hole; season with salt and pepper to taste. Close the lid and cook until the white of the egg has started to set, about 5 to 6 minutes.</li>
    <li>Remove small center waffle from the air fryer. Sprinkle shredded cheese onto egg waffle, and cook until the cheese is melted and egg white is completely set, about 1 or 2 minutes.</li>
    <li>Transfer egg waffle onto a plate; drizzle with maple syrup and serve immediately.</li>
